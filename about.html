                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p> Cozy Coner Caf√© was born from a love of good coffee, great company, and a passion for creating a space where people feel truly welcome. Nestled in the heart of our community, our caf√© started as a small dream ‚Äî to offer more than just coffee, but a place of comfort, creativity, and connection. Every detail, from the aroma of freshly ground beans to the handmade pastries in the window, is carefully crafted to make you feel at home. We partner with local roasters, bakers, and artists to bring you not just a menu, but an experience that supports the neighborhood we love. Whether you're starting your day with a bold espresso, settling in with your favorite book, or catching up with a friend over something sweet, Brew Haven is here for the moments that matter ‚Äî warm, simple, and brewed with heart.</p>
